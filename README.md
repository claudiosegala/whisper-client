# Whisper Client

Defines a script and a library to be used when initializing a client app that communicates with Whisper Admin and Whisper OAuth.

## Life cycle and params

This script/lib takes care of creating the Whisper client in case it does not exist.

Given that, when firing up your client app, you'll need to provide a `client-id`, a `client-secret`, a list of allowed `redirect-uris` and Whisper's endpoint `whisper-url`. 

The scopes that your application is able to ask for when issuing tokens are set via the `scopes` variable.

You can also define the level of event logging by setting the variable `log-level`.

After making sure the client exists in the Whisper instance, this utility starts a client_credentials flow and emits a new Access Token (in case the client has defined a client-secret).

When a client-secret is empty, the client is assumed to be public and can only perform Authorization Code flow with PKCE. Read the [RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)) for more info.

## Use as a lib

The following code should get you started:

```go
import (
    whisperClient "github.com/abilioesteves/whisper-client/client"
)

//...

whisperURL := "http://localhost:7070"
clientID := "client"
clientSecret := "password"
scopes := []string{"client-specific-stuff-01 client-specific-stuff-02"}
loginRedirectURI := "http://redirect"
logoutRedirectURI := "http://redirect"

whisperClient.InitFromParams(whisperURL, clientID, clientSecret, loginRedirectURI, logoutRedirectURI, scopes)

t, err := whisperClient.CheckCredentials()

if err == nil {
    tokenString, err = whisperClient.GetTokenASJSONStr(t)
    //...
}

//...
```

## Use as a CLI utility

The following command should get you started:

```bash
./whisper-client --client-id teste --client-secret teste123 --whisper-url http://localhost:7070/ --redirect-uris http://redirect1,http://redirect2 --log-level debug --scopes test1,test2  > token.json
```

The command above will store the generated token as a file called `token.json`.

## Use it with docker

To enable the use of the utility abover with other languages, one can create a Docker image with it setting up the oauth client.

To use it with Docker, you can add the utility in build time and call it with the `ENTRYPOINT` command.

Example:

```dockerfile
#...

from abilioesteves/whisper-client:0.0.1 as whisper-client

from alpine

COPY --from=whisper-client /whisper-client /

RUN touch token.json
ENTRYPOINT ["/whisper-client", " > ", "token.json"]

#...
```

Then you can reference the `token.json` file in you code and be able to talk with whisper. Other commands will become available in the near future.

**Extra**: To avoid defining multiple same-purpose environment variables, use the `CLIENT_ENV_PREFIX` environment variable to reuse them in your app and in the `whisper-client` utility.
